# Cookbook

Hello to you very warmly.
I would like to introduce you to an application that is my own version of a cookbook. After entering the home page, we are shown an image of an open cookbook, which on the left side shows us a list of available recipes with the ability to filter them by tags and the name of the dish, and allows us to create a new recipe.
Creating a new recipe and editing it includes information such as the name, ingredients with their quantity and weight, description and tags, which are used in the previously mentioned search engine.
In all views on the right side of the application, a real-time preview of the recipe is presented.

The app is under ongoing development. It uses the nest.js API and the MongoDB database.

To launch the application, type the command "ng serve" in the environment.

## Launching the application

To run the application, type the command "ng serve" into the environment.
